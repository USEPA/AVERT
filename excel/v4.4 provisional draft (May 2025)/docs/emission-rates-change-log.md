## AVERT Emission Rates Version History

| Release date | Key changes |
|----------|----------|
| July 31, 2017	  | Original release, containing emission rates from 2007 through 2016. Emission rates calculated using a default displacement of 5% of each region’s fossil generation. |
| May 30, 2018  | Added emission rates for 2017. Revised all emission rates to reflect a default displacement of 0.5% of each region’s fossil generation. Added contextual information about capacity factors and emissions accounting and claims.  |
| June 1, 2018	| Corrected a minor methodological issue that arose when generating the 2017 emission rates.
| May 30, 2019	| Added 2018 emission rates and revised all years to reflect year-specific transmission and distribution line loss factors generated by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). |
| September 15, 2020 | Added emission rates for offshore wind and distributed solar photovoltaic. Revised with emission rates for 2017–2019 using the new AVERT regions associated with AVERT v3.0. |
| October 5, 2021 | Added 2020 emission rates and updated to reflect newer offshore wind capacity factors. Added avoided emission rates for NH3 and VOCs. | 
| March 29, 2022 | Added 2021 emission rates. |
| April 25, 2023 | Added 2022 emission rates. |
| April 11, 2024 | Added 2023 emission rates. Added avoided emission rates for solar PV-plus-storage. |
| _Not formally released_ | Added 2024 emission rates. |
