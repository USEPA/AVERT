The AVERT Statistical Module contains two files and three subfolders. These
folders must stay in the same folder as the Statistical Module for the
program to operate successfully.

The folders are:
- AVERT Future Year Scenarios: This folder contains the future year
    scenario template. Other versions of the future year scenario template
    must be saved in this folder in order for the AVERT Statistical Module
    to see them.
- CAMD Input Files: This folder contains MATLAB-formatted flat data files
    with hourly generation and emissions from each fossil generator in the
    US. The most recent year of data is packaged by default with the 
    AVERT Statistical Module. Other years of data can be obtained from the
    EPA, and must be put in this folder to be accessed by the Statistical 
    Module.
- AVERT Output: This folder will hold Regional Data Files generated by the 
    Statistical Module.


*To Install MATLAB Compiler (MCR)*

A) Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 8.0 (R2012b).   

B) If the MCR is not installed, do the following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MCR Installer.

  (2) run the MCR Installer.

Or download the Windows 64-bit version of the MCR for R2012b 
from the MathWorks Web site by navigating to

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
   
C) For more information about the MCR and the MCR Installer, see 
Distribution to End Users in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.    


NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller.
