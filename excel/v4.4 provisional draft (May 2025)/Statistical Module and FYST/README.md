# EPA’s Avoided Emissions and Generation Tool (AVERT) Statistical Module

This folder contains the AVERT Statistical Module package, which contains the AVERT Statistical Module and the Future Year Scenario Template (FYST).

## AVERT’s Statistical Module
It is recommended that computers operating AVERT’s Statistical Module have at least 2 GB of memory available. Processing time for individual regions depends 
on the number of units in the analysis and the number of processors available. Refer to the AVERT User Manual for step-by-step instructions on using the Statistical Module.

### Step 1: Determine Windows operating environment
Determine if your Windows system operates in a 32-bit or 64-bit environment. Generally, this information is displayed in the “properties” of “My Computer” in Windows XP; 
or “Computer” in Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8; or "My PC" in Windows 10. Click here to determine your Windows environment. The latest version of the Statistical 
Module is only available for 64-bit computers.

### Step 2: Download AVERT’s Statistical Module and MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR)
Download the following two files and save them to your computer:

* AVERT's Statistical Module executable package (exe) (located in this folder)
* MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR): **Download the Windows 64-bit version of the MCR for R2012b** from the [Mathworks website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html).

> **Do not download a newer version of the MCR even if one is available from the Mathworks website.** It is important to download the exact version listed here (R2012b, also known as version 8.0). This is necessary because the AVERT executable is packaged in a form that can only be compiled by an MCR of the same vintage.

### Step 3: Install MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR)
To use AVERT’s Statistical Module, the correct version of the free MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) software needs to be installed. Run the “MCR _R2012b_…installer.exe” 
file that was downloaded in Step 2. Installing this software may require administrator rights. If you do not have rights as an administrator or have any questions, contact 
your IT specialist for assistance.

### Step 4: Unpackage and run the AVERT Statistical Module
Once the AVERT package is downloaded, create a folder on your computer entitled “AVERT Statistical Module.” Place the package (i.e., the “AVERT_Statistical_Module_...pkg.exe” file contained within the zip file) in the folder and run this file. The package will decompress to three files and three subfolders. These folders must stay in the same folder as the Statistical Module for the program to operate successfully.

## AVERT’s Future Year Scenario Template
The “AVERT Future Year Scenario Template ” spreadsheet is downloaded as part of the Statistical Module package. This Excel file is stored in one of the subfolders of the Statistical Module package called “AVERT Future Year Scenarios.” To access and use the Future Year Scenario Template, download the Statistical Module package, following the instructions above. Refer to the AVERT User Manual for instructions on using the Future Year Scenario Template.
For each user-defined scenario, the user is strongly recommended to save this file (in the same subfolder) using the following naming convention:

“AVERT Future Year Scenario Template < Scenario X >” where “Scenario X” is a user-defined name.
