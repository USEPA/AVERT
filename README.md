# EPAâ€™s Avoided Emissions and Generation Tool (AVERT)

AVERT is a free tool with a simple user interface designed to meet the needs of state air quality planners and other interested stakeholders. Anyone can use AVERT to evaluate county, state, and regional changes in emissions from electric power plants and displaced fuel-burning vehicles resulting from energy policies and programs such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, electric vehicles, and energy storage. AVERT is designed to use public data that are accessible and auditable.

Two versions of AVERT are available: a fully-featured Excel version and a streamlined web-based version.

- [AVERT Web Edition](/web)
